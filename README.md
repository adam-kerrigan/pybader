# pybader (v0.1.3)

pyBader is a threaded implementation of grid-based Bader charge analysis. It performs grid-based Bader charge analysis as presented in [W Tang et al 2009 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 21 084204]. Methods have been updated to allow threading over multiple threads. It runs on POSIX systems, Mac OS, and Windows.

## Usage

Installation will create 2 executeables (bader, bader-read) that can be used to run and read the output of the Bader calculation. To view available flags run:

```sh
$ bader --help
$ bader-read --help
```

By default the program bader will output a file called bader.p which is a pickled Bader object. This file can be interpreted by the bader-read script. Human readable files can also be created in place of the bader.p file by supplying the flag --output dat to the main bader program. If you would like this to be the default behaviour (bader.p files contain the entire charge denisty and voxel to Bader volume and/or atom map so can be quite large) there is a config.ini file with sections for all the configurable variables. The location of this varies depending on platform but can be found by checking the pybader.\_\_config\_\_ variable. The current default settings are shown below
```ini
[DEFAULT]
method = neargrid
refine_method = neargrid
vacuum_tol = None
refine_mode = ('changed', 2)
bader_volume_tol = 0.001
export_mode = None
prefix = ''
output = pickle
threads = 1
fortran_format = 0
speed_flag = False
spin_flag = False
```

Check the examples folder and function doc strings for information on how to interface with the python module.

```python
import pybader
from pybader import (
    methods,
    refinement,
    thread_handlers,
    interface,
)
import pybader.io
from inspect import getmembers, ismodule

help(pybader)
help(methods)
help(refinement)
help(thread_handlers)
help(interface)

for name, module in getmemebers(pybader.io, ismodule):
    help(module)
```

## Requirements

pyBader requires a small number of open source projects to work properly, if using pip to install they should be installed automatically:

* [Numpy] - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
* [Numba] - A Just-In-Time Compiler for Numerical Functions in Python.
* [tqdm] - A Fast, Extensible Progress Bar for Python and CLI.

## Installation

It's recommended to create a virtual python environment for the installation using a manager of your choice, this is optional and the docuemented manager is [pyenv]:

```sh
$ pyenv virtualenv pybader
$ pyenv activate pybader
```
Then the package can be installed using one of the methods described below:

### Pip

Use the standard pip installer

```sh
$ pip install pybader
```

### From source

Clone the repositry and make sure setuptools is installed

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/kerrigoon/pybader
$ python pybader/setup.py install
```

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!
Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/kerrigoon/pybader
$ pip install -e pybader/
```

Fiddle away and submit pull requests.
